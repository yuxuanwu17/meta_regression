Forest plot of moderator analysis.

As shown in Figure, we can still conclude that there is a highly positive relationship (Log RR 5.66, 95% CI 5.31-6.02; p-value = 0.12) between the m6A methylation level and the knockdown of the METTL3 gene, although the p-value increases from <0.01 to 0.12 meaning less confidence. The Log RR is adjusted from 6.93 to 5.66. The CI narrows down greatly and CI of each subgroup overlaps more than the basic model, reflecting less between-study variability. As for the METTL14 model, the positive relationship (Log RR 5.39, 95% CI 4.97-5.84; p-value < 0.01) between the m6A methylation level and the absence of METTL14 gene shows similar Log RR with that of METTL3 meta-regression model. Importantly, we found no large heterogeneity or inconsistency of METTL 3 (Q(df = 8) = 12.85, I2 = 37.8%, tau2 = 0.0035) and METTL14 (Q(df = 9) = 45.48, I2= 82.9%, tau2 = 0.0140) among the studies.
